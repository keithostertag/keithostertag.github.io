# Welcome!
This is a notes blog for Keith Ostertag, a collection of notes on programming and personal projects.

The main purpose of this blog is provide a publicly accessible site for me and others to review notes I've made in my journey in writing code. A second purpose is to chronicle various projects that I work on whether they be for coding, photography, home improvements, or other hobbies. And of course maintaining this blog gives me practice with using various tools like git, jekyll, markdown, etc.
