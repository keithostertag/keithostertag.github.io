If you want to add tags to your Jekyll blog but found out that it is simply not supported by Github pages
 here is a link to an excellent article by Long Qian: [Jekyll Tags on Github Pages](http://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/)

 To get the full benefit of using jekyll it is recommended to load it locally (along with Ruby, plugins and other requisites) in order to make your changes locally then simply push your changes to Github. However, if you are comfortable with the command line and for whatever reason don't otherwise use jekyll or Ruby (yet) this article will walk you through creating the file structure, scripts and links to generate tags for your jekyll blog on your Github Page.

 Long Qian's article is very easy to follow and complete in detail. There are a few minor grammar and spelling issues, but these do not inhibit understanding.
