 I volunteered for the Techfest here in Louisville for August 2017 for the morning. Worked with Brian Fox from Level (3). I was able to attend several morning sessions, including my favorite presentation by Genscape (Mike Frohme, Jason Fuchs and Josef Spalenka) as well as a very interesting talk on phishing by Derek Rush of LBMC Information Security.
