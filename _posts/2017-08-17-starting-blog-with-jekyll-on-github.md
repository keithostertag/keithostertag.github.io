The docs say to preview my jekyll blog locally [setting up github pages locally with jekyll]( https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/#requirements):

> We recommend using Bundler to install and run Jekyll. Bundler manages Ruby gem dependencies, reduces Jekyll build errors, and prevents environment-related bugs. To install Bundler, you must install Ruby.

I didn't want to install all that right now, especially since I have no immediate plans to study Ruby (my current priority is python and django). 

So I am following this excellent tutorial by JONATHAN MCGLONE :[Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)
