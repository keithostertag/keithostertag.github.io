Here is a blurb and link discussing JupyterLab.

Also, the first jupytercon started today in NYC: [Jupyter is the new front end for data science and AI](https://conferences.oreilly.com/jupyter/jup-ny)

***
Check out the recording to hear Travis Oliphant, President, Chief Data Scientist & Co-Founder of Continuum Analytics, and Product Marketing Manager Gus Cavanaugh cover:

   The history of notebook environments
   How JupyterLab differs from classic notebooks
   Why JupyterLab will be the default experience for Anaconda Enterprise
   A tour of key functionalities of JupyterLab
   Examples of data science projects developed using JupyterLab

We hope you find the presentation valuable as you begin your JupyterLab journey. In addition, you can download the slides.

If you have questions about JupyterLab or Anaconda Enterprise, or would like more information on how Anaconda empowers your data science team, feel free to reach out to an Ancaonda Ambassador any time.

Best Regards,
Team Anaconda
