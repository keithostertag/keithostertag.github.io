I have thousands of bookmarks that I've accumulated, and organizing them is sometimes time consuming (which is always unfinished business).  

This page is just another way for me to collect some links that I have briefly visited and have found useful for studying threads and processing. Of course I can always run another search, but some of these links I found through recommendations or serendipity.  

I'll occasionally add to this page, but won't attempt to organize them. These exist as prompts for later review.
