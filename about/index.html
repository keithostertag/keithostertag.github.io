<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Welcome!</h1>
	<p>This is a blog for Keith Ostertag, a collection of notes on programming and personal projects.</p>

<div class="about">
<p>Keith has worn many hats in the past- photographer, librarian, electronics tinkerer, generalist and
  life-long learner ...
But currently on a career path toward writing code.</p>
<p>

I've always had a fascination with writing code, but previously had seldom taken formal classes.
In engineering school I took
one self-paced elective in assembly programming which I enjoyed but didn't pursue. I also did some
self-paced home study in C as a hobby for a few months, as well as writing scripts for telecommunications software
 (remember Kermit? Procomm?) and WordPerfect.
Throughout the 1990's I wrote DOS and Windows batch files for creating user interfaces and
streamlining application access for PC software for students and staff, and created the first web site
for the Memorial Library at SUNY Cortland where I worked. For some years I pursued other interests
such as photograpy and electronics (one of my hobbies was repairing vintage analog Tektronics oscilloscopes),
and spent a lot of time renovating houses.

<p>
Starting in late 2016 I began studying online videos at TeamTreehouse.com for web development.
At the start of 2017 I enrolled in my local <a href="https://codelouisville.org/">Code Louisville</a> program to formally study in their class FEWD,
a 12-week course also using Treehouse online videos.
</p>
<p>
  Currently (Fall, 2017) I am studying python and django. My goal is to someday work with data or in QA.

  You can find a few of my code projects on my github page (link is below). You can see the "badges" and "points" I've
  earned at Treehouse (showing the various subjects I've studied there) at this link:

The main purpose of this blog is to provide a publicly accessible site for me and others to review notes
I've made in my journey in writing code. A second purpose is to chronicle various projects that I work
on whether they be for coding, photography, home improvements, or other hobbies. And of course maintaining
this blog gives me practice with using various tools like git, jekyll, markdown, YAML, etc.
